Number of Free Urinals

Problem : In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing. For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4). If there are two adjacent urinals occupied then return -1.

Ex: 
000 -> 2
111 -> -1
010 -> 0
100001 -> 1
